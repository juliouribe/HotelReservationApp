## Hotel Reservation App
This project is one of the projects for the Java programming Nanodegree that I'm working on.

In this project, I built and app that lets user use the CLI to create an account, book rooms, and interact with their reservations. This app also had an admin menu for managing the rooms and users.

The main goal of this project was to get experience with classes, using interfaces, creating an API, and service files. This app is fairly robust when handling user text input. It doesn't crash on user input and has some reservation validation logic to see when reservations overlap with booking dates.
